# Excel-Project---Power-Query

I completed a project that produced a user-friendly report showcasing actionable metrics. This process involved utilizing a power query system in Excel to consolidate data from six large Excel files(each with over 500 rows), encompassing both Payroll and Billing files. Filtering was applied to include only Associate Behavior Technicians and Behavior Technicians, adhering to the employer's specifications. The gathered data encompasses essential details such as Payments for Client Sessions, Client Session Hours, Revenue, and Billable hours for each employee across multiple pay periods.

To ensure adaptability, the query was structured to easily incorporate future file additions. The report includes two pivot tables: one showcasing the ratio of Client session hours to Billable hours by period and employee, while the other displays Gross Profit metrics by region and period, without individual employee breakdown. This strategic approach provides a clear foundation for informed decision-making within these domains.

In addition, it's crucial to note that any absent or unaligned values are cataloged in the "missing values" tab, and these particular values are excluded from the Pivot Table calculations. Notably, Pivot Table 1, focusing on the "ratio of client session hours to billable hours," is conveniently positioned adjacent to the dataset. The arrangement ensures that the pay period and employee ID correspond directly with the ratio of client session hours to billable hours for ease of reference.
